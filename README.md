Okay, heres the update:

Project Updated Progress Report (Gantt/Demo/Trello, etc)
http://ryker.aet.calu.edu/~hah5158/BeaconDrone/projectreports.html

Trello Board with Project Final Documentation Tasks and stuff.
https://trello.com/b/NwjSEWCk

If there is any confusion as to what needs done:

All I need from you guys as far as the final document goes is a plain text document (something like an rtf or txt without much formatting). I need plain info like this because I will be compiling the information using LaTex, which makes everything so much easier for me. It automatically handles the Table Of Contents, Page Numbers, Cover Page, Sources, etc. as well as makes a lot better quality of document. The Trello board conatins all of the relevant information about the current LaTex document as well in case you guys wanted to mess with it at all. Just keep in mind that if you change anything, please back up the previous work. 

Here is the current LaTex Document if you are interested:

In case you guys are having trouble with viewing trello, I have
Attached: The current project pdf file and a pdf file of the trello board.

To be clear what is currently done with document:
Project overview
Project overview
Project goals
Project objective
Criteria for success
Potential risks and obstacles
Let me know what you guys can do to help. We each have to write 15 pages of this document individually.

heres the requirements: http://www.aet.calu.edu/~jsumey/CET492/ProjectDoc.pdf

Let me know whats up, I would like to know what you both want to do so we can have a game plan together. 

Thanks,
